I am doing programming for 24 years now and I don't see myself getting bored with it. There is
always one more thing to learn or to solve and I really want to know everything <i class="far
fa-grin-stars"></i>.

The goal I am most interested in is making my own game engine. But I don't want to take the SDL
library, some image and 3D data loading library and just write rendering logic. I want to learn how
it all works.<!--more--> I want to know how windowing is done on different platforms, how inputs are
processed, how sound is produced, how images or sounds or 3D models are parsed and loaded. I want to
know every little thing that comes on the way.

I don't care that I will never get done. I don't care if in 10 years I am still scratching the
surface. As long as I am learning something new I am happy.

### Obstacles

I do have to confess it is easy to get sidetracked. I want to write the png loader, but for that
I need a decompression library which needs an Adler hashing algorithm. I would check if there are
good implementations of those in the language I am working on but if for any reason I am not happy
about that implementation or I find someone wrote a better one in another language I want to port
that or write a new one that is to my liking.

Sometimes I realize I am not happy with the language I chose so I would investigate others until I
find a new pet. Or if I don't find anything at the moment I might even try to write a
[compiler](https://github.com/igor84/summus) for my own language. At some point I also realize the
path I took doesn't hold my interest any more so I would go back and just choose some other path.
Something interesting to learn is everywhere.

It also surprised me how often the things I learned turned out useful in my job even though I chose
my hobbies to be different. On the other hand, I specifically chose not to go into making my own
operating system. It would be too much removed from my daily work and I do have my limits.

Besides all of this I always have motivation to play some games or watch movies or read books but
about that some other time.

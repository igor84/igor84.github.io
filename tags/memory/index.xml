As Zig grew and gained additional features it had a few redesigns but it is still not without issues so here I want to analyze how it is currently implemented and if we can now do better.
Note There are additional language improvement proposals aiming to improve this exact area like this and this but here I will only present what can be done with Zig today.</description></item><item><title>Basics of Allocating and Using Memory</title><link>https://igor84.github.io/blog/basics-of-allocating-and-using-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 14:05:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://igor84.github.io/blog/basics-of-allocating-and-using-memory/</guid><description>Many of the top used programming languages today use garbage collection and with them we are always taught how manual memory management is hard. I get the feeling that many new programmers don&amp;rsquo;t even try to understand it today.
I want to show here how manual memory management can be not only very easy but also very fun.

There is always one more thing to learn or to solve and I really want to know everything .\nThe goal I am most interested in is making my own game engine. But I don’t want to take the SDL library, some image and 3D data loading library and just write rendering logic. I want to learn how it all works.\nI want to know how windowing is done on different platforms, how inputs are processed, how sound is produced, how images or sounds or 3D models are parsed and loaded. I want to know every little thing that comes on the way.\nI don’t care that I will never get done. I don’t care if in 10 years I am still scratching the surface. As long as I am learning something new I am happy.\nAnd I do have to confess it is easy to get sidetracked. I want to write the png loader, but for that I need a decompression library which needs an Adler hashing algorithm. I would check if there are good implementations of those in the language I am working on but if for any reason I am not happy about that implementation or I find someone wrote a better one in another language I want to port that or write a new one that is to my liking.\nSometimes I realize I am not happy with the language I chose so I would investigate others until I find a new pet. Or if I don’t find anything at the moment I might even try to write a compiler for my own language. At some point I also realize the path I took doesn’t hold my interest any more so I would go back and just choose some other path. Something interesting to learn is everywhere.\nIt also surprised me how often the things I learned turned out useful in my job even though I chose my hobbies to be different. On the other hand, I specifically chose not to go into making my own operating system. It would be too much removed from my daily work and I do have my limits.\nBesides all of this I always have motivation to play some games or watch movies or read books but about that some other time.\n","description":"","tags":["personal","game","engine"],"title":"How do I stay motivated","uri":"/blog/how-do-i-stay-motivated/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"personal","uri":"/tags/personal/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Tags","uri":"/tags/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Blog","uri":"/blog/"},{"content":"What is the closest thing in this world to magic?\nTo me it will always be programming. You type in some incantations and stuff happens :).\nHere I want to document and share my explorations into this magic world. My most recent trip went into Zig land so most of the articles will talk about that.\nBut who am I? I got my first PC in 1997, when I was 13 years old and got my hands on my first programming language somewhere in 1998. It was QBasic and I created some of the first games and programs in it. I wrote Hangman, Mastermind, Breakout and even did something like a Paint program.\nI shortly switched to Pascal and then jumped to Delphi (or Object Pascal). There I learned about SDL library and OpenGL and did a clone of Nintendo’s Battle city game.\nWhile doing that I realized how hard it is to create UI for a game, especially compared to Delphi which I consider is still unmatched in ease of use for creating desktop UIs. So, as I was finishing high school, I wrote a UI library called SDLControls for Object Pascal.\nDuring high school I also learned a bit about assembler and how CPUs work on a lower level. It was fascinating at the time.\nAs college started I lost my free time and didn’t do much outside of school projects which included Pascal, C, Java, C# and PHP. Straight from college I started working on Java bussiness software in 2007. During the next four years I would move from the first company, to the second and third until in 2011 I got a job at a startup gaming company. One of the first in my country.\nThe company was a success and 11 years later I am still working there doing my dream job. Suprisingly, for my younger self it turned out not to be making games itself, but rather making tools for making games .\nI started on some web applications with PHP and Javascript and then moved to Unity and C#. But that fascination about inner workings of the PC from younger days is still burning in me so I still find some side projects to play with in my free time.\nCasey Muratory with his Handmade Hero series series and Jonathan Blow with his talk about a custom compiler were a great inspiration. Thanks to them I refreshed my C knowledge and wrote a tiny compiler, Summus, as a sort of introduction to writing one using LLVM as a backend.\nI then learned what I could about other new languages and among Rust, Go, Nim and DLang I chose the latter as most intuitive and powerful language. Coming from Unity and C# DLang seemed like a perfect language for a Game Engine. It supports garbage collection but also manual memory management so it seemed like I could use it to write both low level systems and later use as gameplay logic language as well. No need for separate scripting language.\nUnfortunatelly I got dissapointed with some drawbacks of the language and the fact that its leadership didn’t seem very interested to work on those things. At the time Odin and Zig also came under my reader and so I decided to play with Zig and document my journey here.\nAnd so here we are!\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About Me","uri":"/more/about-me/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","uri":"/categories/"}]
